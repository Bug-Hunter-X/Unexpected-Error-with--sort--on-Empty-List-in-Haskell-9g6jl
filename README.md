This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Haskell related to the `Data.List.sort` function.  The issue occurs when attempting to sort an empty list.  While not immediately obvious, this can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes depending on the context. The `bug.hs` file shows the problematic code and `bugSolution.hs` demonstrates the solution.  This example highlights the importance of handling edge cases when working with list manipulation functions in Haskell.
